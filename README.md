###

I am currently a research intern at **Aalto University** in Finland, working with [Adrien Corenflos](https://adriencorenflos.github.io/) on probabilistic numerics applied to stochastic differential equations. 

Prior to that, I was a quantitative research intern at **Lombard Odier Investment Managers**, Multi-Asset team, in Switzerland. My supervisor was Serge Tabachnik.

I am pursuing a dual degree, a M.Sc. in Machine Learning at **Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay** (MVA) and a M.Eng. in Statistics at **ENSAE - Institut Polytechnique de Paris**.

I enjoy solving intertwined theoretical and technical problems.

Here is my [curriculum vitæ](https://github.com/hallelujahylefay/curriculum_vitae/blob/main/CV.pdf).
