I am pursuing a dual degree, a M.Sc. in Machine Learning at **Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay** (MVA) and a M.Eng. in Statistics and Financial Engineering at **ENSAE - Institut Polytechnique de Paris**.

I enjoy solving intertwined theoretical and technical problems.

Here is my [curriculum vitæ](https://github.com/hallelujahylefay/curriculum-vitae/blob/main/CV.pdf).
